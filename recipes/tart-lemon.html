         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p><strong>These tart lemon "pies" are a lovely conclusion to an elegant spring dinner! I garnish them with whipped cream, a strawberry fan, and a sprig of mint.</strong></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Process 1 cup flour, butter, and 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar in a food processor for 10 seconds, or blend with a pastry blender until a dough forms. Pat dough evenly into a 9-inch round pie plate.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While crust bakes, combine eggs, white sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and 3 tablespoons flour; mix until smooth. Pour egg mixture over hot crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm, 15 to 20 minutes more. Let cool completely in pie dish, about 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar and cut into 12 triangles.</li>
            
        </ol>
